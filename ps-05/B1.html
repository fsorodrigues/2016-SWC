                <p>In one of his most famous editorial design works, Walter Levy applies <em>gestalt</em> principles in order to organize the image around one whole concept. </p>
                <p><strong>Continuation</strong> happens in two instances. After reading the book title in the first plan, our eyes naturally flow into the picture blurred background right behind. The drawing also shows continuity itself as it transitions from a human figure into a cockroach.<br>
                <strong>Anomally</strong> is expressed in the color change on the background, going sharply from grey to black. The effect on the drawing is emphasizing the metamorphosis portraied in the book. <br>
                <strong>Closure</strong> is also present in the composition between the drawing and the background. Both the human figure and the cockroach are negative-space products.<br>
                <strong>Proximity</strong> is also applied, as the human and cockroach figures put together are a much stronger message for the metamorphosis.</p>
                <p><strong>Walter Lewy</strong> (1905-1995) was born in Germany and lived most of his life in Brazil as a painter, illustrator, and designer. He also worked in the ad industry.<br>
                His first contact with art was in Dortmund, Germany in the 20s. There he would get involved with magical realism concepts, laying the ground for his journey into surrealism.
                During World War II, Lewy fled to Sao Paulo, where he set his new permanent residence. Many of his paintings were destroyed by the bombings in Germany and the Netherlands. <br>
                After getting acquainted with the most prominent artists in Brazil, he started painting again, being one the very few artists in Brazil dedicated to surrealism.</p>
